Get GPS co-ordinates of current user position
Use two co-ordinates to measure distance between them
Plot GPS co-ordinates on sprite
Extract sprite image to measure its area
Divide sprite image/shape into more workable shapes
Measure respective areas
Design app UI


Method One- GPS Dependent
Start recording button and record all GPS points until stop is hit
Then USe GPS points to esimate area

Method Two- Accelerometer Dependent(Gradient fail)
Start recording button and commence couting 'footsteps'
User has to hit the turning button on each turn until when back to startng point when stop button is hit
Generate guess of area layout with recordings

Method Three- Image and estimate area from image
*Angle of inclination required
*User's height
*Point/Level of holding phone


Product functions
The application must let the user measure the length of a plot boundary and calculate the area of a plot
	Take GPS readings and measure distancebetween two recorded points
	Take Accl. Readings and approximate walking behaviour
	Generate approximation of plot layout
	Calculate the area of a plot based on this recorded data
	Store saved calculations

Design and implementation constraints
	Availability of device with both hardware components
	Availability of wide range of devices for testing system, coupled with lack of appropriate devices to run the required emulators
	The system will make use of the GPS component that is widely known for its power drain especially on low end devices... Developers will have to ensure the efficient use of this component... Especially important because both hardware componets will be in use at the same time if available
	Internet Access... for accurate GPS readings
	Design for minimal future maintenance... reduce technical debt
	Where feasible, developers are expected to follow Android design guidelines, which include but are not limited to material design and efficient memory use
